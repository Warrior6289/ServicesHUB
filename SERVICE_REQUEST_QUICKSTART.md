## üìä Mock Data Available

The system includes realistic mock data:
- 10 sample service requests
- Various categories: Plumber, Electrician, Welder, etc.
- Different statuses to test each state
- Price boost examples
- Multiple locations in New York area

Access mock data in code:
```typescript
import { mockServiceRequests, getMockInstantRequests } from './mocks/serviceRequests';
```

## üîß Configuration

### Polling Interval (Seller Dashboard):
```typescript
// In SellerDashboardPage.tsx
intervalMs: 20000, // Change to adjust polling frequency (ms)
```

### Broadcast Radius:
```typescript
// In ServiceRequestForm.tsx
broadcastRadius: 10, // Default radius in km
// Slider: 5-50km range
```

### Request Expiration:
```typescript
// Currently hardcoded to 1 hour for instant requests
expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 60 * 1000)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Map Not Showing:
- Check browser console for Leaflet errors
- Ensure `leaflet.css` is imported in `main.tsx`
- Check that marker icons are loading correctly

### Geolocation Not Working:
- Ensure HTTPS or localhost (geolocation requires secure context)
- Check browser permissions
- Try different browser if issues persist

### Polling Not Working:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `useMockData: true` in polling hook
- Check that component is mounted (seller dashboard visible)

### No Incoming Requests:
- Polling uses mock data by default
- Check `getMockInstantRequests()` returns data
- Verify status filter (only shows pending/boosted)

## üì± Responsive Testing

Test on different screen sizes:
- **Desktop:** Full layout with sidebars
- **Tablet:** 2-column grids become single column
- **Mobile:** All sections stack vertically, map height reduces

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test all buyer flows** - Create, view, boost, cancel
2. **Test seller flows** - View, sort, accept requests
3. **Test different request types** - Instant vs Scheduled
4. **Test edge cases** - Expired requests, cancelled requests
5. **Test responsiveness** - Mobile, tablet, desktop

## üí° Tips

- Use browser dev tools to test different screen sizes
- Open seller dashboard in one tab, buyer in another to see real-time updates
- Check console for API call simulations
- Price boost modal has quick buttons for common increases
- Map is scrollable and zoomable
- Dark mode works throughout!
