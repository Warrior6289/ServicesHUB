## 🚀 Production Readiness

### Currently Using Mock Data
The implementation uses mock data by default for development. To switch to production:

1. **In RequestServicePage:** Uncomment API imports and use real API calls
2. **In UserDashboardPage:** Use `getUserRequests()` instead of `getMockUserRequests()`
3. **In SellerDashboardPage:** Set `useMockData: false` in polling hook
4. **In ServiceRequestDetailsPage:** Use `getRequestById()` API call

### Backend Integration Points
All API functions are ready in `src/api/serviceRequests.ts`:
- POST `/service-requests/instant`
- POST `/service-requests/scheduled`
- PATCH `/service-requests/:id/boost-price`
- GET `/service-requests/user`
- PATCH `/service-requests/:id/cancel`
- GET `/service-requests/nearby?radius=X&categoryId=Y`
- POST `/service-requests/:id/accept`
- GET `/service-requests/seller`
- PATCH `/service-requests/:id/status`
- GET `/service-requests/:id`

## ✨ Additional Features Implemented

1. **Auto-conversion handling:** UI displays when instant requests are converted to scheduled
2. **Price history tracking:** Shows all price boosts with timestamps and percentages
3. **Notification permissions:** Requests browser notification permission for sellers
4. **Window focus detection:** Refreshes data when user returns to tab
5. **Optimistic UI updates:** Immediate feedback on actions before API confirmation
6. **Empty states:** Helpful empty states with CTAs in all list views
7. **Loading states:** Skeleton loaders and spinners throughout
8. **Error handling:** Try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
